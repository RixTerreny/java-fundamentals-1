Java exercise to practise fundamental knowledge of this language.
## Info
This repo is split in 2 exercise: 

The first one generate the cost of a train's ticket given 2 input from the user such as age and path length, knowing that if he is under 18 he will get a discount of 20%, if he is over 65 they will get 40% discount, while if his age is between 18 and 65 he will have to pay the full prized ticket.

[Decimal format docs](https://www.baeldung.com/java-decimalformat) used to achive bonus of the first exercise. (formatted cost of the ticket with only 2 decimals)

The second exercise is a program that, given a number from the user, it prints all the number from 0 to the chosen one, but replace multiples of 3 with the words "fizz", multiples of 5 with "buzz" and multiples of both numbers with "fizzBuzz"
